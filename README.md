# JavaScript Drum Kit

This project was built with starter code from the [JavaScript 30 challenge](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30).

## What I Learned About:
- key events
- playing audio
- listening for transition end event

App can be found at: https://taylornoj.github.io/drumKit/

In addition to completing the challenge for this app, I personalized the display.
